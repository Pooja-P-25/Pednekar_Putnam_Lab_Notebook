# KNOW YOUR NUDIBRANCHS:NUDIBRANCHS FROM NEW ENGLAND 

*This post is a fun post about the four nudibranch species I found in the intertidal rocks of Nahant, MA while tidepooling in the Spring 2025.*

## **NUDIBRANCHS (nudus: Naked; brankhia: gills)**
Nudibranchs are marine soft-bodied mollusks which have two main characteristics. They lack a shell unlike any other snail/mollusk and have external gills either in the form of gill plume or cerata.

There are typically two kinds of nudibranchs:

A. Dorid Nudibranch- Flat disc shaped body, external gills on the back looking like a plume or tree.

B. Aeolid Nudibranch- Unlike dorids, aeolids have a narrow mantle with finger like extensions/projections called as the cerata (external gills in aeolids).
